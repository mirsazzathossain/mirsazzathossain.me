## Create an SSH Tunnel from Your Machine

To access a private server (`private-server`) inside a remote network, establish an SSH tunnel through a publicly accessible server (`gateway-server`).

```bash
ssh -L 2222:192.168.1.100:22 user@gateway-server
```

- `-L 2222:192.168.1.100:22` → Forwards local port `2222` to `private-server:22`.
- `user@gateway-server` → The intermediate server with public access.

  Note: Replace `192.168.1.100` with the actual private server IP inside the remote network.

## Open a New Terminal and Connect to the Private Server

```bash
ssh -p 2222 user@localhost
```

Now, you're securely connected to `private-server`!

## Run the Tunnel in the Background

To keep the tunnel running in the background, use:

```bash
ssh -f -N -L 2222:192.168.1.100:22 user@gateway-server
```

- `-f` → Run in background.
- `-N` → Do not execute remote commands, only forward ports.

## Automate the Tunnel with SSH Config

Add the following to `~/.ssh/config` on your local machine for quick access:

```ini
Host private-tunnel
    HostName gateway-server
    LocalForward 2222 192.168.1.100:22
```

Now, simply run:

```bash
ssh private-tunnel
ssh -p 2222 user@localhost
```

This setup allows seamless access to a private server behind a firewall using SSH tunneling!
